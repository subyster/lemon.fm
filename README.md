## Welcome to Lemon.fm

I built this project in order to improve my skills with ReactJS, with light and dark themes while using Last.fm API.
You can check here your most scrobbled artist for the last month and even further, plus seeing general info and your last 5 tracks

I have plans to add connection to Spotify's API in future

You can check the App running at [Lemon.fm](https://lemonfm.herokuapp.com)
